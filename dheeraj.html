<p>Cultivation of food in space<br>
Tissue culture<br>
Tissue culture is the process of growing fragments of plants individually in labs using nutrients. This process could be used in our spaceship for the growth of more yields in a less time.
Why tissue culture?
Tissue culture increases the yield in a short time it is also already implemented in earth
Advantages of tissue culture<br>
1.  Exact copy of the plant can be created using a fragment of that plant<br>
2. It can be easily genetically modified <br>
3.  It can be easily used to make copy of same plant by using a small part of it.<br>
4. Less chance of causing diseases.<br>
Aeroponics<br>
Aeroponics is the process of sending nutrients to the plants through air .This could also be used in our spaceship for the growth of food. This process solves the problem of not having soil in our spaceship 
Advantages:<br>
1. It requires less amount of water for the growth of plants<br>
2. It also needs less use of pesticides<br>
3. It occupies less space<br>
4. it is also environment friendly<br>
It also comes with some disadvantages which are:<br>
Disadvantages<br>
1. High maintenance cost<br>
2. High cost for initial setup<br>
3. High level of technology knowledge is needed.
